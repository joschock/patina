//! A module for the [Service] param type and any common service traits.
//!
//! The [Service] [Param] is a wait for components to produce and consume services defined by an interface (`Trait`)
//! that is agnostic to the underlying concrete implementation. It also allows a single concrete type to be used as
//! multiple services by implementing multiple traits on the same type and specifying the services trait(s) in the
//! [IntoService] derive macro.
//!
//! To simplify the management of services, the underlying datum is *always* readonly. This means that only `&self`
//! interface methods will be available to consumers of the service. If a service needs to be mutable, it should use
//! interior mutability to achieve this.
//!
//! The backing data is maintained as a static untyped type, which allows for one service to use another service in
//! it's implementation without needing to know about the underlying type or worry about lifetimes of holding one
//! service inside of another service.
//!
//! Similar to other [Param] implementations, any component that consumes a service will not be dispatched until the
//! services is produced, which allows for ordered dispatch of components that depend on each other. As mentioned
//! above, if one service depends on another service, not only will the service be produced first, but that service
//! can also be consumed by the dependent service before being produced
//!
//! ## Protocol Backwards Compatability
//!
//! While not suggested, it is possible to publish a service as an EDKII compatible protocol for backwards
//! compatability with existing EDKII code, allowing for a rust service to be consumed by an EDKII driver. As mentioned
//! multiple times, this is **only** for backwards compatability and should be avoided if possible. Any rust to rust
//! component interactions should be done through the [Service] [Param] type. Please review the [IntoService] trait on
//! how to register a service as an EDKII protocol.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ### Implementing a Service
//!
//! See [IntoService][patina_macro::IntoService] macro for more information on how to implement a service. While the
//! macro does not have to be used, it is recommended to ensure the service is implemented correctly.
//!
//! ### Basic Service Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use patina::{
//!    error::Result,
//!    component::{
//!        service::{IntoService, Service},
//!        Storage,
//!    }
//! };
//!
//! trait MyService {}
//!
//! #[derive(IntoService)]
//! #[service(dyn MyService)]
//! struct MyServiceImpl;
//!
//! impl MyService for MyServiceImpl {}
//!
//! // This component will not be dispatched until the `MyService` service is produced.
//! fn my_component(service: Service<dyn MyService>) -> Result<()> {
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//!
//! // This component will be dispatched before `my_component` as it produces the `MyService` service.
//! fn service_producer(storage: &mut Storage) -> Result<()> {
//!     let service = MyServiceImpl;
//!     storage.add_service(service);
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Services Consuming Other Services
//!
//! The below example shows how one service can consume another service when producing the service.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use patina::{
//!   error::Result,
//!   component::{
//!     service::{IntoService, Service},
//!     Storage,
//!   }
//! };
//!
//! trait Service1 {}
//! trait Service2 {}
//!
//! #[derive(IntoService)]
//! #[service(dyn Service1)]
//! struct Service1Impl;
//!
//! impl Service1 for Service1Impl {}
//!
//! #[derive(IntoService)]
//! #[service(dyn Service2)]
//! struct Service2Impl {
//!    service1: Service<dyn Service1>,
//! }
//!
//! impl Service2 for Service2Impl {}
//!
//! fn service1_producer(storage: &mut Storage) -> Result<()> {
//!   let service = Service1Impl;
//!   storage.add_service(service);
//!   Ok(())
//! }
//!
//! fn service2_producer(storage: &mut Storage, service1: Service<dyn Service1>) -> Result<()> {
//!   let service = Service2Impl { service1 };
//!   storage.add_service(service);
//!   Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
